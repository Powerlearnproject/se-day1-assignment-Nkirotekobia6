Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
engineering methods and tools used to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It enables creation of software applications that help the modern life eg in communication, entertainment

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
in the 1960s there was establishment of software engineering as a discipline, 1970s the beginning of structured programming and in 2000s the rise of agile methodlogies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement stage where you document the user needs and system requirements,
Design stage at this stage you crreate high level and detailed software designs of software architecture and user interface.
Implement stage here there's writing code and building software according to design specification
Testing stage conduct tests to ensure code meets quality standard and design specification
Deployment stage here the software is released to  the users
Maintance stage here you provide support and ensure maintance of software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodologies follow a sequenctial approach with distinct phases e.g requirement stage,design stage, implementation stage while agile methodologies are iterative and incremental focus on flexibility collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a software developer writes code and implements software solutions
Quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project manager: oversees the planning ,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: provide software tools used for writing, debugging and testing code e.g visual studio,eclipse
VCS: helps in tracking changes to source code  and coordinating work among team members eg github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing it is the testing of individual components or modules of software.
integration testing :testing interactions between different components and subsystems
system testing: testing the entire sofware system as a whole
acceptance testing: testing the software against user requirements to ensure they user requirements ensuring they meet user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the art of crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps best and most suitable responses from your ai assistant.Interacting with AI models enhances personalized assistance, efficiency, and accessibility, supports learning and innovation, and provides valuable feedback for improvement. It fosters human-AI collaboration and helps address ethical considerations, driving advancements in technology and enriching user experiences.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1.write code for html web page
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
2.write code for html web page with cat phots showing different breeds with clear user page
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Cat Breeds</title>
  <style>
    /* Style the page */
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      text-align: center;
    }
    .cat-image {
      max-width: 300px;
      margin: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Cat Breeds</h1>
  <div>
    <img class="cat-image" src="images/persian-cat.jpg" alt="Persian Cat">
    <img class="cat-image" src="images/maine-coon.jpg" alt="Maine Coon Cat">
    <img class="cat-image" src="images/siamese-cat.jpg" alt="Siamese Cat">
    </div>
